I'm a big fan of Ruby on Rails; have been ever since it's first appearance to the public in 2005. I'm proficient with many technologies, but I keep coming back to the world of Ruby on Rails. I can't ignore a decade of success with the framework.
But Rails isn't my only mainstay. I use many Ruby gems and technologies in the start-ups I've established or participated.

The "Rails Way" works for me. Love the lingo. Scrum, DRY, TDD, CI, Git, Mocking, Stubbing... One day I'll learn what all those mean. :)

I'm also heavily involved with <a href="http://activeadmin.info/" target="_blank">ActiveAdmin</a> - the best administrative dashboard <i>EVER!</i>
I'm available for consulting, training, and integration.
