After sitting in digital storage for over a decade, I'm excited to finally share my 2014 PluralSight audition video on integrating WYSIWYG editors into ActiveAdmin.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; margin: 2rem 0;">
  <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FVfnqV4lr_c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## What It's About

This tutorial walks through the complete process of integrating TinyMCE (a popular WYSIWYG editor) into ActiveAdmin, covering:

- Adding the `tinymce-rails` gem (Rails 3 era!)
- Configuring TinyMCE with custom toolbars and plugins
- Working around ActiveAdmin's unique architecture (object-oriented vs framework-oriented)
- Using Formtastic to apply CSS classes to text areas
- Following Yahoo's YSlow best practices for JavaScript placement

## The Time Capsule Effect

Recording date: **February 14, 2014**  
Publication date: **January 23, 2026**  
Time elapsed: **Nearly 11 years**

It's fascinating to look back at Rails 3, pre-Webpacker asset pipeline, and the state of rich text editing before ActionText existed. Some things have changed dramatically—others remain surprisingly relevant.

## Why I Made This (Then and Now)

**2014:** This was an audition video for a comprehensive ActiveAdmin course with PluralSight. While the full course never materialized due to my professional commitments, I am pleased with the technical depth and teaching approach in this footage.

**2026:** During some routine harddrive cleanup, I came across this video and I'm finally sharing it because:
- The retro aesthetic fits perfectly with my current portfolio theme
- It demonstrates teaching ability and technical communication
- It's a fun "before ActionText" historical artifact
- Someone might still find the information useful (ActiveAdmin + TinyMCE is still a valid stack!)

## What's Next

I'm planning to create more content around:
- Modern Rails patterns and best practices
- CTO/technical leadership insights
- Legacy Rails modernization strategies
- No-drama deployment pipelines

See you again in 12 years! 8-)
