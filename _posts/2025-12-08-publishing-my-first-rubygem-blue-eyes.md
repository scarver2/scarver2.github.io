I'm excited to announce that I've published my first RubyGem: **Blue Eyes** - a developer tool for fast scaffolding of Sinatra applications and microservices, with an upgrade path to Ruby on Rails.

## The Story

In the Ruby software development community, there's a tradition of taking over maintenance of abandoned gems when the original author moves on. Blue Eyes was one such gem - a solid foundation that needed some love and modernization.

I acquired the Blue Eyes project, refreshed the gem, updated the templates for modern Ruby/Sinatra best practices, and published it to RubyGems. This marks my first official contribution as a gem maintainer!

## What Blue Eyes Does

Blue Eyes is a scaffolding tool that helps developers quickly spin up Sinatra applications with sensible defaults:

- **Fast setup** - Generate a working Sinatra app in seconds
- **Modern templates** - Updated for current Ruby and Sinatra versions  
- **Microservices-ready** - Perfect for building lightweight APIs
- **Rails upgrade path** - Start small, scale when needed

It's designed for developers who want the simplicity of Sinatra without starting from scratch every time.

## Why This Matters to Me

This project represents several firsts:
- **First published RubyGem** as a maintainer
- **First gem acquisition** - taking over community maintenance
- **First complete refresh** of an existing codebase for modern standards

It also aligns with my philosophy of pragmatic engineering: start simple (Sinatra), ship fast, upgrade when complexity demands it (Rails).

## What's Next

I'm planning to:
- Add more template options

- Build out CI/CD templates for common deployment scenarios
- Continue maintaining and improving based on community feedback

If you're building Sinatra apps or microservices, give Blue Eyes a try! Contributions, issues, and feedback are always welcome.
